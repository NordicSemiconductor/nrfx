 * byte already has started, @ref nrfx_uarte_tx returns instead of waiting for the transfer to end.
 */
#define NRFX_UARTE_TX_EARLY_RETURN NRFX_BIT(1)

/**
 * @brief Flag indicating that the @ref nrfx_uarte_tx call will be linked to an active transfer.
 *
 * UARTE DMA registers are buffered which means that once transfer is started, registers with
 * transfer details (pointer and length) can be overwritten. If that is combined with the (D)PPI
 * connection between ENDTX and STARTTX events, then two transfers are linked together and
 * bytes are transferred without any gap allowing to utilize the maximum bandwidth.
 *
 * When the flag is set, it indicates that the user can set up an ENDTX-STARTTX (D)PPI connection and
 * wants to perform linked transfers. It is the user's responsibility to disable the (D)PPI connection
 * when the last transfer is started. If the user does not set up an ENDTX-STARTTX (D)PPI connection, then
 * the transfer is restarted from the context of ENDTX event handling which is earlier than context
 * of the @ref NRFX_UARTE_EVT_TX_DONE. The flag has no impact if used while there is no ongoing
 * transfer.
 *
 * For example, if a sequence consists of three transfers, then the first @ref nrfx_uarte_tx
 * can be called with or without the flag and the following two transfers must have the flag
 * set. The second @ref nrfx_uarte_tx can be called immediately after the first one and the third
 * one after the first @ref NRFX_UARTE_EVT_TX_DONE event. After the second
 * @ref NRFX_UARTE_EVT_TX_DONE event is received, the (D)PPI connection must be disabled (if it was
 * used).
 *
 * When (D)PPI connection is used, then it is critical that (D)PPI connection is disabled on time,
 * before the last transfer is completed. Otherwise, the transfer will be repeated, and unwanted data
 * will be transferred. Hence, it is recommended to use longer buffers. Time needed to
 * send the buffer must be longer than the maximum system latency.
 *
 * When the flag is used, then the driver instance must not use the ENDTX-STOPTX (D)PPI connection.
 *
 * When linked transfers are used, then blocking transfers (see @ref NRFX_UARTE_TX_BLOCKING and
 * @ref NRFX_UARTE_TX_EARLY_RETURN) cannot be performed. An error is returned when the flag is set
 * and the @ref nrfx_uarte_tx is called during ongoing blocking transfer.
