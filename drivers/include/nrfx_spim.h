 * @brief Function for starting the SPIM data transfer.
 *
 * Additional options are provided using the @c flags parameter:
 *
 * - @ref NRFX_SPIM_FLAG_TX_POSTINC and @ref NRFX_SPIM_FLAG_RX_POSTINC -
 *   Post-incrementation of buffer addresses.
 * - @ref NRFX_SPIM_FLAG_HOLD_XFER - Driver is not starting the transfer. Use this
 *   flag if the transfer is triggered externally by PPI. Use
 *   @ref nrfx_spim_start_task_address_get to get the address of the start task.
 *   Chip select must be configured to @ref NRF_SPIM_PIN_NOT_CONNECTED and managed outside the driver.
 *   If you do not expect more transfers, you should call @ref nrfx_spim_abort to inform the driver
 *   that the peripheral can be put into a low power state.
 * - @ref NRFX_SPIM_FLAG_NO_XFER_EVT_HANDLER - No user event handler after transfer
 *   completion. This also means no interrupt at the end of the transfer.
 *   If @ref NRFX_SPIM_FLAG_NO_XFER_EVT_HANDLER is used, the driver does not set the instance into
 *   busy state, so you must ensure that the next transfers are set up when SPIM is not active.
 *   Additionally, you should call @ref nrfx_spim_abort to inform the driver that no more transfers will occur.
 *   @ref nrfx_spim_end_event_address_get function can be used to detect end of transfer. Option can
 *   be used together with @ref NRFX_SPIM_FLAG_REPEATED_XFER to prepare a sequence of SPI transfers
 *   without interruptions. If you do not expect more transfers, you should call @ref nrfx_spim_abort
 *   to inform the driver that the peripheral can be put into a low power state.
 * - @ref NRFX_SPIM_FLAG_REPEATED_XFER - Prepare for repeated transfers. You can set
 *   up a number of transfers that will be triggered externally (for example by PPI). An example is
 *   a TXRX transfer with the options @ref NRFX_SPIM_FLAG_RX_POSTINC,
 *   @ref NRFX_SPIM_FLAG_NO_XFER_EVT_HANDLER, and @ref NRFX_SPIM_FLAG_REPEATED_XFER. After the
 *   transfer is set up, a set of transfers can be triggered by PPI that will read, for example,
 *   the same register of an external component and put it into a RAM buffer without any interrupts.
 *   @ref nrfx_spim_end_event_address_get can be used to get the address of the END event, which can
 *   be used to count the number of transfers. If @ref NRFX_SPIM_FLAG_REPEATED_XFER is used,
 *   the driver does not set the instance into busy state, so you must ensure that the next
 *   transfers are set up when SPIM is not active. If you do not expect more transfers, you should call
 *   @ref nrfx_spim_abort to inform the driver that the peripheral can be put into a low power state.
 *
 * @note Peripherals using EasyDMA (including SPIM) require the transfer buffers
 *       to be placed in the Data RAM region. If this condition is not met,
 *       this function will fail with the error code -EACCES.
 *
 * @param p_instance  Pointer to the driver instance structure.
 * @param p_xfer_desc Pointer to the transfer descriptor.
 * @param flags       Transfer options (0 for default settings).
 *
 * @retval 0        The procedure is successful.
 * @retval -EBUSY   The driver is not ready for a new transfer.
 * @retval -ENOTSUP The provided parameters are not supported.
 * @retval -EACCES  The provided buffers are not placed in the Data RAM region.
