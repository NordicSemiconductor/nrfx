/* Function that handles firmware-driven enabling or disabling of APPROTECT on devices where it is supported.
        If ENABLE_APPROTECT is defined, the FW will lock the fw branch of the APPROTECT mechanism,
                            preventing it from being opened.
        If ENABLE_APPROTECT_USER_HANDLING is defined, the FW will not write to the fw branch of the APPROTECT mechanism.
                            This allows later stages of the fw to handle APPROTECT,
                            for example to implement authenticated debug.
        Otherwise, the fw branch state is loaded from UICR.

         The same mechanism is implemented for SECURE APPROTECT, with the macros
         ENABLE_SECURE_APPROTECT and ENABLE_SECURE_APPROTECT_USER_HANDLING. */
