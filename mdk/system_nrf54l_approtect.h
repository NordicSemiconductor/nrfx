/* Function that handles firmware-driven enabling or disabling of APPROTECT on devices where it is supported.
        If ENABLE_APPROTECT is defined, the FW will lock the fw branch of the APPROTECT mechanism,
                            preventing it from being opened.
        Otherwise, the fw branch state is loaded from UICR, emulating the legacy APPROTECT behavior.

         The same mechanism is implemented for SECURE APPROTECT, with the macros
         ENABLE_SECURE_APPROTECT and ENABLE_SECURE_APPROTECT_USER_HANDLING. */
